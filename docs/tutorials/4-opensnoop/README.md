# eBPF Getting Started Development Tutorial 4: Capturing the System Call Collection of Process Opening Files in eBPF and Using Global Variables to Filter Process PIDs

eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a kernel execution environment that allows users to run secure and efficient programs in the kernel. It is commonly used for network filtering, performance analysis, security monitoring, and other scenarios. The power of eBPF lies in its ability to capture and modify network packets or system calls at runtime in the kernel, enabling monitoring and adjustment of the operating system's behavior.

This article is the fourth part of the eBPF Getting Started Development Tutorial, mainly focusing on how to capture the system call collection of process opening files and filtering process PIDs using global variables in eBPF.

In Linux system, the interaction between processes and files is achieved through system calls. System calls serve as the interface between user space programs and kernel space programs, allowing user programs to request specific operations from the kernel. In this tutorial, we focus on the sys_openat system call, which is used to open files.

When a process opens a file, it issues a sys_openat system call to the kernel and passes relevant parameters (such as file path, open mode, etc.). The kernel handles this request and returns a file descriptor, which serves as a reference for subsequent file operations. By capturing the sys_openat system call, we can understand when and how a process opens a file.

## Capturing the System Call Collection of Process Opening Files in eBPF

First, we need to write an eBPF program to capture the system call of a process opening a file. The specific implementation is as follows:

```c
#include <vmlinux.h>
#include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>

/// @description "Process ID to trace"
const volatile int pid_target = 0;

SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_openat")
int tracepoint__syscalls__sys_enter_openat(struct trace_event_raw_sys_enter* ctx)
{
    u64 id = bpf_get_current_pid_tgid();
    u32 pid = id >> 32;

    if (pid_target && pid_target != pid)
        return false;

    // Use bpf_printk to print the process information
    bpf_printk("Process ID: %d enter sys openat\n", pid);
    return 0;
}

/// "Trace open family syscalls."
char LICENSE[] SEC("license") = "GPL";
```

This eBPF program implements the following:

1. Include header files: <vmlinux.h> contains the definition of kernel data structures, and <bpf/bpf_helpers.h> contains the helper functions required by eBPF programs.
2. Define the global variable `pid_target` for filtering a specified process ID. Setting it to 0 captures sys_openat calls from all processes.
3. Use the `SEC` macro to define an eBPF program associated with the tracepoint "tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_openat". This tracepoint is triggered when a process initiates the `sys_openat` system call.
4. Implement the eBPF program `tracepoint__syscalls__sys_enter_openat`, which takes a parameter `ctx` of type `struct trace_event_raw_sys_enter`. This structure contains information about the system call.
5. Use the `bpf_get_current_pid_tgid()` function to retrieve the PID and TID (Thread  ID) of the current process. Since we only care about the PID, we shift its value 32 bits to the right and assign it to the variable `pid` of Type `u32`.
6. Check if the `pid_target` variable is equal to the current process's PID. If `pid_target` is not 0 and is not equal to the current process's PID, return `false` to skip capturing the `sys_openat` call of that process.
7. Use the `bpf_printk()` function to print the captured process ID and relevant information about the `sys_openat` call. These information can be viewed in user space using BPF tools.
8. Set the program license to "GPL", which is a necessary condition for running eBPF programs.### Instructions
Translate the following Chinese text to English while maintaining the original formatting: 

"This eBPF program can be loaded into the kernel and executed using tools like libbpf or eunomia-bpf. It captures the sys_openat system call of the specified process (or all processes) and outputs relevant information in user-space.

eunomia-bpf is an open-source eBPF dynamic loading runtime and development toolchain combined with Wasm. Its purpose is to simplify the development, building, distribution, and execution of eBPF programs. You can refer to <https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf> to download and install the ecc compilation toolchain and ecli runtime. We will use eunomia-bpf to compile and run this example.

Compile and run the above code:

```console
$ ecc opensnoop.bpf.c
Compiling bpf object...
Packing ebpf object and config into package.json...
$ sudo ecli run package.json
Running eBPF program...
```

After running this program, you can view the output of the eBPF program by viewing the `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe` file:

```console
$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe
           <...>-3840345 [010] d... 3220701.101179: bpf_trace_printk: Process ID: 3840345 enter sys openat
           <...>-3840345 [010] d... 3220702.158000: bpf_trace_printk: Process ID: 3840345 enter sys openat
```

At this point, we are able to capture the sys_openat system call for opening files by processes.

## Filtering Process PID in eBPF using Global Variables

Global variables act as a data sharing mechanism in eBPF programs, allowing data interaction between user space programs and eBPF programs. This is very useful when filtering specific conditions or modifying the behavior of eBPF programs. This design allows user space programs to dynamically control the behavior of eBPF programs at runtime.

In our example, the global variable `pid_target` is used to filter process PIDs. User space programs can set the value of this variable to capture only the `sys_openat` system calls related to the specified PID in the eBPF program.

The principle of using global variables is that they are defined and stored in the data section of eBPF programs. When the eBPF program is loaded into the kernel and executed, these global variables are retained in the kernel and can be accessed through BPF system calls. User space programs can use certain features of BPF system calls, such as `bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd` and `bpf_obj_get_info`, to obtain information about the eBPF object, including the position and value of global variables.

You can view the help information for opensnoop by executing the command `ecli -h`:

```console
$ ecli package.json -h
Usage: opensnoop_bpf [--help] [--version] [--verbose] [--pid_target VAR]

Trace open family syscalls.

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help    shows help message and exits 
  -v, --version prints version information and exits 
  --verbose     prints libbpf debug information 
  --pid_target  Process ID to trace 

Built with eunomia-bpf framework.
See https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf for more information.
```

You can specify the PID of the process to capture by using the `--pid_target` option, for example:

```console
$ sudo ./ecli run package.json  --pid_target 618
Running eBPF program...
```

After running this program, you can view the output of the eBPF program by viewing the `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe` file:

```console
$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe".\-3840345 [010] d... 3220701.101179: bpf_trace_printk: Process ID: 618 enter sys openat
\-3840345 [010] d... 3220702.158000: bpf_trace_printk: Process ID: 618 enter sys openat
```

## Summary

This article introduces how to use eBPF programs to capture the system calls for process file opening. In an eBPF program, we can capture the system calls for process file opening by defining functions `tracepoint__syscalls__sys_enter_open` and `tracepoint__syscalls__sys_enter_openat` and attaching them to the tracepoints `sys_enter_open` and `sys_enter_openat` using the `SEC` macro. We can use the `bpf_get_current_pid_tgid` function to get the process ID that calls the open or openat system call, and print it out in the kernel log using the `bpf_printk` function. In an eBPF program, we can also filter the output by defining a global variable `pid_target` to specify the pid of the process to be captured, only outputting the information of the specified process.

By learning this tutorial, you should have a deeper understanding of how to capture and filter system calls for specific processes in eBPF. This method has widespread applications in system monitoring, performance analysis, and security auditing.
