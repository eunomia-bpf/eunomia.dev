# Using eBPF Programs on Android

> This article mainly documents the author's exploration process, results, and issues encountered while testing the level of support for CO-RE technology based on the libbpf library on high version Android kernels in the Android Studio Emulator. The test was conducted by building a Debian environment in the Android Shell environment and attempting to build the eunomia-bpf toolchain and run its test cases based on this.

## Background

As of now (2023-04), Android has not provided good support for dynamic loading of eBPF programs. Both the compiler distribution scheme represented by bcc and the CO-RE scheme based on btf and libbpf rely heavily on Linux environment support and cannot run well on the Android system.[^WeiShu]

However, there have been some successful cases of trying eBPF on the Android platform. In addition to the solution provided by Google to modify `Android.bp` to build and mount eBPF programs with the entire system[^Google], some people have proposed building a Linux environment based on the Android kernel and running the eBPF toolchain using this approach, and have developed related tools.

Currently available information mostly focuses on the testing of bcc and bpftrace toolchains based on the adeb/eadb sandbox built on the Android kernel, with less testing work on the CO-RE scheme. There is more reference material available for using the bcc tool on Android, such as:

+ SeeFlowerX: <https://blog.seeflower.dev/category/eBPF/>
+ evilpan: <https://bbs.kanxue.com/thread-271043.htm>

The main idea is to use chroot to run a Debian image on the Android kernel and build the entire bcc toolchain within it in order to use eBPF tools. The same principle applies to using bpftrace.

In fact, higher versions of the Android kernel already support the btf option, which means that the emerging CO-RE technology in the eBPF field should also be applicable to Linux systems based on the Android kernel. This article will test and run eunomia-bpf in the emulator environment based on this.

> [eunomia-bpf](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf) is an open-source project that combines libbpf and WebAssembly technology, aiming to simplify the writing, compilation, and deployment of eBPF programs. This project can be seen as a practical way of implementing CO-RE, with libbpf as its core dependency. It is believed that the testing work of eunomia-bpf can provide reference for other CO-RE schemes.

## Test Environment

+ Android Emulator (Android Studio Flamingo | 2022.2.1)
+ AVD: Pixel 6
+ Android Image: Tiramisu Android 13.0 x86_64 (5.15.41-android13-8-00055-g4f5025129fe8-ab8949913)

## Environment Setup[^SeeFlowerX]

1. Obtain `debianfs-amd64-full.tar.gz` from the releases page of the [eadb repository](https://github.com/tiann/eadb) as the rootfs of the Linux environment. Also, get the `assets` directory from this project to build the environment.
2. Configure and start the Android Virtual Device in the Android Studio Device Manager.
3. Push `debianfs-amd64-full.tar.gz` and the `assets` directory to the AVD using the adb tool from the Android Studio SDK:
   + `./adb push debianfs-amd64-full.tar.gz /data/local/tmp/deb.tar.gz`
   + `./adb push assets /data/local/tmp/assets`
4. Use adb to enter the Android shell environment and obtain root permissions:
   + `./adb shell`
   + `su`
5. Build and enter the debian environment in the Android shell:
   + `mkdir -p /data/eadb`
   + `mv /data/local/tmp/assets/* /data/eadb`
   + `mv /data/local/tmp/deb.tar.gz /data/eadb/deb.tar.gz`+ `rm -r /data/local/tmp/assets`
   + `chmod +x /data/eadb/device-*`
   + `/data/eadb/device-unpack`
   + `/data/eadb/run /data/eadb/debian`

At this point, the Linux environment required for testing eBPF has been set up. In addition, in the Android shell (before entering debian), you can use `zcat /proc/config.gz` in conjunction with `grep` to view kernel compilation options.

>Currently, the debian environment packaged by eadb has a low version of libc and lacks many tool dependencies. Additionally, due to different kernel compilation options, some eBPF features may not be available.

## Build Tools

Clone the eunomia-bpf repository into the local debian environment. For the specific build process, refer to the repository's [build.md](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf/blob/master/documents/build.md). In this test, I used the `ecc` compilation method to generate the `package.json`. Please refer to the [repository page](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf/tree/master/compiler) for the build and usage instructions for this tool.

>During the build process, you may need to manually install tools such as `curl`, `pkg-config`, `libssl-dev`, etc.

## Results

Some eBPF programs can be successfully executed on Android, but there are also some applications that cannot be executed successfully for various reasons.

```

Note: some error messages may appear in the Android shell during the test:

```console
libbpf: failed to determine tracepoint 'syscalls/sys_enter_open' perf event ID: No such file or directory
libbpf: prog 'tracepoint__syscalls__sys_enter_open': failed to create tracepoint 'syscalls/sys_enter_open' perf event: No such file or directory
libbpf: prog 'tracepoint__syscalls__sys_enter_open': failed to auto-attach: -2
failed to attach skeleton
Error: BpfError("load and attach ebpf program failed")
```

Later, after investigation, it was found that the kernel did not enable the `CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS` option, which resulted in the inability to use the tracepoint of syscalls.

## Summary

The `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF` option is enabled by default when viewing the kernel compilation options in the Android shell. Based on this, the examples provided by the eunomia-bpf project already have some successful cases, such as monitoring the execution of the `exec` family of functions and the status of TCP connections.

For some cases that cannot run, the reasons are mainly the following:

1. The kernel compilation options do not support the relevant eBPF functionality;
2. The Linux environment packaged by eadb is weak and lacks necessary dependencies;

Currently, using eBPF tools in the Android system still requires building a complete Linux runtime environment. However, the Android kernel itself has comprehensive support for eBPF. This test proves that higher versions of the Android kernel support BTF debugging information and CO-RE dependent eBPF programs.

The development of eBPF tools in the Android system requires the addition of official new features. Currently, it seems that using eBPF tools directly through an Android app requires a lot of effort. At the same time, since eBPF tools require root privileges, ordinary Android users will encounter more difficulties in using them.
