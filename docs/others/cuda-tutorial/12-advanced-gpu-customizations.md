## Thread Divergence Mitigation

GPU performance relies heavily on executing the same instructions across threads in a warp (a group of 32 threads that execute in SIMT fashion). When threads within a warp take different execution paths due to conditional branching, performance suffers significantly.

### The Problem

When threads in a warp diverge, the hardware must serialize execution, drastically reducing performance:

```cuda
// High divergence based on thread ID (problematic)
if (threadIdx.x % 2 == 0) {
    // Even threads take expensive path
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        result = sinf(result) * cosf(result) + 0.1f;
    }
} else {
    // Odd threads take simple path
    result = input[idx] * 2.0f;
}
```

In this code, every alternate thread within a warp takes a different path, forcing serialized execution.

### The Solution

Restructure code to ensure threads in the same warp take the same execution path:

```cuda
// Low divergence based on block ID (better)
if (blockIdx.x % 2 == 0) {
    // All threads in even-indexed blocks take expensive path
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        result = sinf(result) * cosf(result) + 0.1f;
    }
} else {
    // All threads in odd-indexed blocks take simple path
    result = value * 2.0f;
}
```

This approach ensures entire warps take the same path, eliminating intra-warp divergence.

### Best Practices

1. **Organize your data** to minimize divergence (sort by similar processing needs)
2. **Move conditionals to higher levels** (block level instead of thread level)
3. **Consider predication** for short divergent sections
4. **Restructure algorithms** to avoid divergent paths
5. **Use warp-level voting functions** to make uniform decisions

## Register Usage Optimization

Registers are the fastest memory on the GPU, but they are a limited resource. High register usage per thread can limit occupancy (the number of warps that can run concurrently on a multiprocessor).

### The Problem

Using too many variables within a kernel can increase register pressure:

```cuda
// High register usage
float a1 = input[idx];
float a2 = a1 * 1.1f;
float a3 = a2 * 1.2f;
// ... many more variables
float a16 = a15 * 2.5f;

// Complex computation using many variables
for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    a1 = a1 + a2 * cosf(a3);
    a2 = a2 + a3 * sinf(a4);
    // ... and so on for many variables
}
```

This approach consumes many registers per thread, limiting the number of warps that can run simultaneously.

### The Solution

Reduce register count by reusing variables and restructuring computations:

```cuda
// Optimized register usage
float result = input[idx];
float temp = result * 1.1f;

// Replace multiple variables with loop iterations
for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    // Reuse the same variables in computations
    result = result + temp * cosf(result);
    temp = temp + result * sinf(temp);
    // ...
}
```

### Register Optimization Techniques

1. **Reuse variables** rather than creating new ones
2. **Use loop unrolling judiciously** to balance between parallelism and register pressure
3. **Consider `__launch_bounds__`** to control maximum registers per thread
4. **Analyze PTX output** to identify register usage
5. **Trade computation for registers** when appropriate

## Mixed Precision Computation

Modern GPUs support various precision formats, from 64-bit double precision to 16-bit half precision. Leveraging lower precision where appropriate can significantly increase computational throughput.

### The Technique

Perform computations in lower precision while maintaining accuracy by using higher precision for critical operations:

```cuda
// Convert to half precision for computation
half x_f16 = __float2half(x_f32);

// Compute in FP16
half i_f16 = __float2half(i * 0.01f);
half mult = __hmul(x_f16, i_f16);

// Convert back to FP32 for accuracy-sensitive operations
float sin_val = sinf(__half2float(mult));

// Accumulate in FP32 for better precision
result += sin_val;
```

### Benefits of Mixed Precision

1. **Higher computational throughput** - many GPUs offer 2-8x more throughput for FP16 vs FP32
2. **Reduced memory bandwidth** requirements - smaller data types need less bandwidth
3. **Lower memory footprint** - more data fits in caches
4. **Tensor core utilization** - specialized hardware for mixed precision computation on newer GPUs

### Best Practices

1. **Accumulate in higher precision** to prevent error accumulation
2. **Use lower precision for bulk computation** where accuracy is less critical
3. **Analyze numerical stability** of your algorithm to determine safe precision levels
4. **Consider scale factors** to maintain dynamic range in lower precision formats
5. **Test accuracy** against full-precision baseline

## Persistent Threads for Load Balancing

Traditional CUDA programming assigns a fixed workload to each thread. For workloads with variable execution time, this can lead to load imbalance and idle threads.

### The Problem

With traditional work assignment, threads with light workloads finish early and remain idle:

```cuda
// Traditional approach - fixed work assignment
int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
if (idx < size) {
    int work_amount = workloads[idx];  // Variable workloads
    // Do work...
}
```

### The Solution: Persistent Threads

Keep threads alive and let them dynamically grab new work items from a queue:

```cuda
// Persistent threads approach
while (true) {
    // Atomically grab next work item
    int work_idx = atomicAdd(&queue->head, 1);
    
    // Check if we've processed all items
    if (work_idx >= size) break;
    
    // Process the work item
    int work_amount = workloads[work_idx];
    // Do work...
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Improved load balancing** - threads that finish early get more work
2. **Higher hardware utilization** - less idle time for processing units
3. **Better scaling** for irregular workloads
4. **Lower thread management overhead** - fewer thread launches
5. **More predictable performance** - less sensitivity to workload distribution

## Warp Specialization Patterns

Different computations have different execution characteristics. Warp specialization assigns different tasks to different warps within a thread block.

### The Technique

Identify warp ID and assign specialized tasks based on it:

```cuda
int warpId = threadIdx.x / WARP_SIZE;

// Specialize warps for different tasks
if (warpId == 0) {
    // First warp: Trigonometric computations
    for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        result += sinf(value * i * 0.01f);
    }
} else if (warpId == 1) {
    // Second warp: Polynomial computations
    float x = value;
    float x2 = x * x;
    result = 1.0f + x + x2/2.0f + x3/6.0f + x4/24.0f;
} 
// Other warps get different tasks...
```

### Benefits

1. **Cache utilization** - specialized warps might use different cache lines
2. **Instruction cache optimization** - fewer total instructions per warp
3. **Reduced divergence** - specialized code paths have less branching
4. **Pipeline efficiency** - specialized tasks may utilize different execution units
5. **Memory access pattern optimization** - different warps can use different memory patterns

### Applications

1. **Task-parallel algorithms** with distinct phases
2. **Producer-consumer patterns** - some warps produce data, others consume it
3. **Cooperative processing** - divide complex algorithms into specialized subtasks
4. **Heterogeneous workloads** - compute-bound vs memory-bound tasks

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing these advanced customization techniques, consider:

1. **Measure impact** - Customize based on profiling data, not assumptions
2. **GPU architecture differences** - Different generations may respond differently to optimizations
3. **Balance complexity vs. maintainability** - Advanced techniques can make code harder to understand
4. **Test across problem sizes** - Performance characteristics can change with input scale
5. **Consider portability** - Some techniques may not work well across all hardware
